<h1>Accessibility statement for Renfrewshire Council MyAccount</h1>
<p>We want everyone who visits the Renfrewshire Council MyAccount website to feel welcome and find the experience rewarding, going above and beyond the The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/contents/made">Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018</a>.</p>
<p>This website is run by the Customer Technology team at Renfrewshire Council and is designed to be used by as many people as possible. The text should be clear and simple to understand. You should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>zoom in up to 300% without problems.</li>
<li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard.</li>
<li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software.</li>
<li>use most of the website using a screen reader.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are we doing?</h2>
<p>To help us make the Renfrewshire Council MyAccount website a positive place for everyone, we've been using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a>. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.</p>
<p>The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). We've chosen Level AA as the target for the Renfrewshire Council MyAccount website.</p>
<h2>How are we doing?</h2>
<p>We're working hard to achieve our goal of Level AA accessibility, but we realise there are some areas that still need improving and we are only partially compliant with <span>the </span><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a><span><span> </span>AA standard</span>.</p>
<p>Our approach to accessibility is iterative, transparent and always under review to make a better experience for all of our users. Our current road map for improvements is an ongoing audit of MyAccount, its pages and forms - implementing changes towards a comprehensive inspection before October 2022.</p>
<p>The following information explains what areas are currently seen as non-accesible, how we've deemed it does not meet success criteria and what we're doing to make the appropriate changes.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 1.3.1 - <span>Info and Relationships</span>:</h3>
<p>Site sections including iFrames do not appear to make use of correct mark-up to convey structure and relationships. We will be working with our system provider to make sure improvements are made.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 1.3.2 - <span>Meaningful Sequence</span>:</h3>
<p>Focus states are not clear enough on some site elements including the main navigation and buttons found on form pages. This stops the correct reading sequence from being determined programmatically. We will be reviewing our focus styles around the site to make them as clear as possible.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 1.3.5 - <span>Identify Input Purpose</span>:</h3>
<p>The select input on MyRequest page does not appear to include relevant meta-data to identify its purpose. This area is controlled by the software and service provider. We will raise this issue with the service provider.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 1.4.1 - <span>Use of Colour</span>:</h3>
<p>Some navigation, call to actions and form elements only use colour to convey information. We will be reviewing these areas and plan to update their syle and behaviour.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 1.4.11 - <span>Non-text Contrast</span>:</h3>
<p>Some components and icons do not meet contrast requirements for AA standard. We will be undertaking a design review for the site to ensure correct levels of contrast ratios are met.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 1.4.13 - <span>Content on Hover or Focus</span>:</h3>
<p>Dynamic content on user services pages Accounts and MyRequests need to be reviewed to ensure hover or focus does not interfere with using the site.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum):</h3>
<p>Some brand colours do not meet contrast requirements for AA standard. We will be doing a design audit of these areas and altering colours or font sizes as required.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 2.1.1 - <span>Keyboard</span>:</h3>
<p>Some of our system pages have changeable dynamic content which has still to be reviewed. Until this has been done we cannot commit to ensuring all content is operable via a keyboard.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 2.2.1 - Timing Adjustable:</h3>
<p>We have updated our site time limit to 360 minutes which is the maximum our software allows. We will raise this accessibility issue with the software provider as it still does not comply with 2.2.1 - Timing Adjustable.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 2.4.1 - Bypass Blocks:</h3>
<p>We need to review our building structure for forms to ensure there is a consistency for the ability to bypass blocks of content.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 2.4.2 - Page Titled:</h3>
<p>Two site pages: home page and contact us, do not appear to have a title that describes the topic and purpose. We will be working with our software supplier to make sure these outlier examples are fixed and behave like all other site pages.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 2.4.3 - Focus Order:</h3>
<p>Changeable dynamic content of Accounts and MyRequest pages still have to be reviewed to make sure logical paths preserving meaning and operability are followed.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 2.4.4 - Link Purpose (In Context):</h3>
<p>Changeable dynamic content of Accounts and MyRequest pages still have to be reviewed to make sure the purpose of links are clear when read in context.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 2.4.6 - Headings and Labels:</h3>
<p>We need to review our building structure for forms to ensure there is a consistency for headings and labels describing topic and purpose for the user.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 2.4.7 - Focus Visible:</h3>
<p>Keyboard focus is not always obvious or visible on navigation, call to actions and form elements - failing this accessibility criteria. We plan to review all focus states site wide to produce more consistent and clear results.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 2.5.3 - Label in Name:</h3>
<p>Some of the pages generated by the software do not appear to make full use of labels for components to comply with accessibility criteria. We will work with out software supplier to improve this.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 3.3.1 - Error Identification:</h3>
<p>We need to review dynamic content on Accounts and MyRequest site pages to make sure any errors are identified and descried to the user correctly.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 3.3.2 - Labels or Instructions:</h3>
<p>Search and Select input elements used on system pages (All Services, MyRequests) need to be reviewed to ensure required labels and instructions are present. These areas are controlled by the software service provider.</p>
<p>We need to review our building structure for forms to ensure there is a consistency for the inclusion of labels and instructions.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 3.3.3 - Error Suggestion:</h3>
<p>System pages Accounts and MyRequests need to be reviewed with their changeable dynamic content to ensure error messages are provided to the user when appropriate.</p>
<h3>Success criteria 4.1.3 - Status Messages:</h3>
<p>The status message for the search function on the All Services page needs to be reviewed further to make sure it can be progmmatically determined without loosing focus.</p>
<h3>PDFs and non-HTML documents</h3>
<p>Documents created in programmes and save in file formats such as PDF's to be used or accessed via our site are not always accessible. This can include but is not limited to missing text alternatives and missing document structure.</p>
<p><span>Non-HTML documents published before September 2018 do not need to be accessible - unless users need them to use a service.</span></p>
<h3 id="disproportionate-burden">Disproportionate burden</h3>
<p>Addressing some accessibility problems can be considered a disproportionate burden due to resources and costs involved to resolve. This would be taken into consideration if there are plans for future development work that would address issues as part of the project.</p>
